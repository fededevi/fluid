    \brief Alert dialogs are urgent interruptions to inform the user about a situation.

    An alert dialog is used to interrupt the user's workflow to inform them about
    a situation that requires their acknowledgement.

    Most alert don't need a title and they summarize a decision in a sentence or two
    by either asking a question or making a statement related to the action buttons.
